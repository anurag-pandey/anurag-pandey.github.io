I have always been excited by seeing the tools that people use in their life. Hence, I am sharing the most important ones that I use.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Apps</h3>
<ol>
  <li> <a href="https://readwise.io/i/anurag761"> Readwise</a> - Outstanding app for reading, collecting documents and tracking the highlights. Spend most of my free time using this. </li>
  <li> <a href="https://arc.net/gift/306a3b57"> Arc</a> - Browser for my laptop. Incredibly easy to switching profiles across work and personal. Love the ability to use websites in full screen. </li>
  <li> <a href="https://affiliate.notion.so/806ngnl48hhf"> Notion </a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/product/calendar"> Notion Calendar</a> - Manage information, calendars and to-dos. Amazing for connecting information and collecting variety of information.</li>
  <li> <a href="https://bitwarden.com/download/"> Bitwarden</a> - Great open source password manager that gets the job done. Free plan is much better than free plans of all other competitors.</li>
